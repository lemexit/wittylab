		<h2 id="guide">Quick Guide</h2>
		<div class="inner">
			<p>The installation of this script is very trivial. Simply follow the instructions below and you will be ready to launch your new media site in about 5 minutes from now.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Upload and extract the compressed file <strong>main.zip</strong> to the root of your server.</li>
				<li>Make sure that the folder content and all of its sub-folders are writable (Permission 755)</li>
				<li>Point your browser to your site and you should be redirected to the installer. If not point your browser to http://yoursite.com/install.php</li>
				<li>Once on the installer, read and follow instructions as the installer will guide through the installation of this script.
					<ul>
						<li>On the <strong>Database Configuration</strong> page, the field <strong>Database Prefix</strong> is optional. Fill this only if you have multiple tables in the same database</li>
						<li>The field <strong>Server Timezone</strong> is the timezone of your server! This is used to provide accurate consistent time server-wide. If you don't know your server's timezone, you can pick anything then change it later via the file includes/Config.php</li>
						<li>The <strong>Security Key</strong> is a random string that is used to encode data with. This should not be changed after the installation.</li>
						<li><strong>Note</strong> If you get blank page in step 3 then the script was not able to open the file includes/Config.sample.php or it wasn't able to rename it to includes/Config.php. You will need to do this manually!</li>
					</ul>
				</li>				
			</ol>
			<h3 id="upgrading">Upgrading (<a href="upgrade.html">click here for more info</a>)</h3>
			<p>All upgrading instructions are detailed in "upgrade.html" located in the same folder as this file. Simply open that and follow the instructions according to the version of the script. Please note that some update may require you to replace all files while others only a couple of files. In both cases it is strongly recommended that you first backup all your existing files and download it to your computer.</p>

		<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
		<div class="inner">
			<p>Here is a glimpse of some of the most awesome features this script has to offer.</p>
			<h3>Import. Import. Import.</h3>
			<p>
				Import what ever you want and however you want. A lot of effort has went into the import system so you can import anything from some majors sites like Youtube, Vine, Vimeo, Dailymotion, etc. Here is how you can import media.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Import using the URL to the video</li>
				<li>Import using the Bookmarklet that is found in the admin panel > Import a Single Video</li>
				<li>Mass Import from Youtube using the live admin interface</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Add Custom Media</h3>
			<p>
				You would rather upload a custom media? No problem. Use the interface to upload video and image files of the following format: mp4, jpg, png and gif. Please note that this script doesn't convert videos nor does it generate thumbnails from videos!
			</p>

			<h3>Featured and NSFW</h3>
			<p>
				You can tag a media file as featured and/or NSFW to make them stand from other media. Featuring a video will prioritize that video while tagging it as NSFW will prevent users who have NSFW option disabled to view them. Regarding NSFW, you will have to make sure that you add the minimum age required to register in your TOS because if a user registers they will have access to NSFW content.
			</p>

			<h3>Report</h3>
			<p>
				Registered users can report any content. Whether it is a media file, user or comment, it can be reported. You will be able to moderate reports via the admin panel.
			</p>

			<h3>Categories and Types</h3>
			<p>
				One of the most important feature of this script is the ability to assign a type. Assigning a type to media makes a big difference so you have to make sure to properly assign it. For example don't assign a picture the video category or vice versa. The built-in types are <strong>video, music, vine and picture</strong>. This gives you the ability to run a one-script-multimedia-site with ease. You also have to properly assign a type of the categories.
			</p>

			<h3>User Profile and Subscription</h3>
			<p>
				User can subscribe to each other and receive notification when there is a new media.
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="content">
		<h2 id="settings">Script Configuration</h2>
		<div class="inner">
			<p>Once you have successfully installed the script, you will be able to fully customize it before importing/adding media. Login as admin then you will see your own admin bar at the very top of the script. This admin is dynamic meaning that the content will change depending on which page you are. Look at the right side to find Configuration and click that to configure the script.</p>	

			<h3 id="generals">General Settings</h3>		
			<p>Under this tab you will find all of the important settings you will need for your site. Fill these as you wish. Notice the email field is used for many things. It first of all used as the sender when the script sends an email. So you will want to make sure you provide a good email. Also filling the social links will activate sidebar widgets. Please make sure that the link you provide is working and is of the proper format.</p>

			<h3 id="apps">Application Settings</h3>
			<p>This tab groups the main settings you will need to customize your site. Their function is very easy to understand so there is not much to say more. Notice the "Blacklist Words" field as this is used to filter bad words and replace them by an asterisk *. You will need to separate words with a comma. Example badword1,badword2,badword3</p>

			<h3 id="secs">Security Settings</h3>
			<p>You can enabled catpha to prevent bots from creating accounts or submitting forms. To do so you have options: reCaptcha or Solvemedia. reCaptcha is a very popular captcha system provided by Google. It is free and you can use you Google account to create keys. Solvemedia is another alternative however this system allows you to monetize on captchas. Once you create your account they will give three keys. You will need to add those keys in the file includes/library/Solvemedia.php.</p>

			<h3 id="medias">Media Settings</h3>
			<p>These settings allows you to change how media looks and upload settings. The display mode setting will switch the script from being a more Youtube-style to a 9gag-style.</p>

			<h4>Local Thumbnails</h4>
			<p>This a very important setting so you will want to clear your mind on whether you want to store them locally or link to them. You must <strong>not</strong> change this after your have upload/imorted your first media! All thumbnail are stored in the /content/thumbs folder.</p>
			
			<h4>Maximum Upload Size</h4>
			<p>This is another important setting. The maximum upload size is determined by your server configuration. Look under this field to determine what is your maximum upload limit. Note that if you set a size higher than this, the script will set the lower limit as the size limit. Example if you set 100MB and your server's limit is 10 MB then the script will set it as 10 MB.</p>

	<div class="content">
		<h2 id="users">User Configuration</h2>
		<div class="inner">
			<h3 id="facebook"><b>Facebook Connect</b> </h3>

			<p>You will notice that Facebook connected has now been integrated to this application. Users can now login with their Facebook and bookmark their favorite sites. To set up your app, first go to <a href="https://developers.facebook.com">https://developers.facebook.com</a> and set up a new app by clicking "Apps". Then click "Create New App"; Facebook will ask you to configure your app. The most important fields you must fill out are <b>App Domains</b> and <b>Site URL</b>. Following that Facebook will generate two keys for you. Go to admin settings and paste those keys. That's it. If you did everything correctly Facebook connect should work.</p>

			<h3 id="twitter"><b>Twitter Connect</b></h3>

			In this version, twitter connect has been added. Now users can login using twitter the same way they use Facebook. You must enable twitter connect for it to appear and function. You can do that on the admin panel. You must register your website on Twitter.com. 
			<h4>Instructions</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/apps" target="_blank">https://dev.twitter.com/apps</a> and Login.</li>
				<li>Then click "Create a new application" on top right</li>
				<li>Fill the required fields (with a start next to it), add this to the callback field: http://YOUSITE.com/, accept the terms and conditions and click "Create your Twitter application".</li>

			</ol>	
			<p>If you did everything correctly, Twitter OAuth should work. If it doesn't, send me an email and I will help you.</p>

			<h3 id="google"><b>Google Connect</b> </h3>
			<p>
				Google connect protocol has been changed due to restrictions from Google. For this reason you will need to set up Google connect again. Simply follow the instructions below and it should be fairly simple.
			</p>

		<h2 id="adss">Advertisement Configuration</h2>
		<div class="inner">
			<p>
				This script allows you to add any advertisement code you wish and it will display it wherever it fits. You can also enable or disable ads with a single click. The three main sizes are 728x90, 468x60 and 300x250. However there are also two other slots. One that is reserved for video pre-roll and the other one should be a responsive ad because it will be shown on mobile platforms. Notice if you empty the preroll ad then it will not show up otherwise it will show before the viewer is able to click play. You can also change the time the viewer has to wait before being able to play a video.
			</p>		

			<p>
				You can easily display any of the ads anywhere you want to by using the following php code: <pre>&lt;?php echo $this->ads('<strong><em>SIZE</em></strong>'); ?&gt;</pre> where <strong>SIZE</strong> can be any of the following: 728, 468, 300, rep

			<h3>The installer is stuck at step 3 and I am seeing a blank page.</h3>
			<p>Although this can be caused by many reasons, a common cause is that the script was not able to open and write in the file includes/Config.sample.php. Open this file and check if your DB info has been saved. If not manually replace the placeholders (like RHOST,RUSER) by the actual info. Another reason you may see a blank page at step 3 is that the script wasn't able to rename the file includes/Config.sample.php to includes/Config.php. You will need to do this manually.</p>

			<h3>The time is showing as a negative or huge value.</h3>
			<p>
				If the time is shown correctly then that means your server's timezone was not set correctly. You will need set the correct timezone to fix this. To set the timezone, open the file includes/Config.php and add your timezone on right side of arrow. You can get your timezone from <a href="https://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php">https://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php</a>.
			</p>

			<h3>I keep getting a 404 page whenever I click on something.</h3>
			<p>
				If you get a 404 page (the one generated by your server) then that means you did not upload the file .htaccess or your server doesn't support the mod rewrite module. If you did not upload the file .htaccess then you will need to upload to the root of your server. If for some reason you cannot see that file in the package, you will need to create that file using cpanel's editor (or equivalent) to create a new file named <strong>.htaccess</strong> and put the following code in it.
<pre>
AddType video/mp4 .mp4
RewriteEngine On
Rewritebase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^admin/(.*)?$ admin/index.php?a=$1 [QSA,NC,L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.*)?$ index.php?a=$1	[QSA,NC,L]
ErrorDocument 404 /index.php?a=404
